# Money
Money is a funny thing, It makes the world function and is basically a requirement in our society, something which can prove your worth, it's used to judge the perceived value of the person and compared to by other for where they sit on that totem pole. I've personally always had a very poor perception of the value money has, while I don't come from the most wealthy family in the world we are definitely middle class and didn't need to worry about not having food on the table, which is quite a bit better than many other people, as soon as I started working I went straight to a decent salary, and then from there got to a top 10%? of income for my country, which I didn't realise for quite a while and because of this I've always been able to buy what I've wanted really, I don't generally go for the most expensive things, but at the same time I do spend a lot of money which I don't need to.

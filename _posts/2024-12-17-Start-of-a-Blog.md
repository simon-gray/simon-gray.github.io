# The Start of a Blog
For some time now I've been thinking about creating a blog, not just for the technical stuff that I'm interested in but also just about life experiences and things that I think are cool.

It'll also be a good opportunity for me to work with different types of technology while creating notes on how I did it, although sadly my current intention isn't to help other people, but I'm hoping that I'll be able to change my perspective on that in the future.

I've tried tracking things through tools like obsidian.md and some diary like apps, however I've never really been a huge fan of them.
Hopefully this is something that I'll be able to continue doing


## Personal Privacy
Something I've **always** been concerned about is privacy.

While I'm not a very social person, I do have some social media, personally I really don't like it at all that much, and intending to use it much less, if at all.

This is also an opportunity, and opportunity to give others a look into my life and perspective on things

### Hosting Location

Right now I'm hosting it with github.io, however due to the limitations on access control I won't be staying here. I think that managing the entire infrastructure is something which I want to do, it'll give me a change to go the full infrastructure route.

## Blog Content
While I think it'll be cool to document my thoughts and have a look at them later I want it to be a combination of a few things:

<div style="display: flex;">
    <ul>
        <li>Life perspectives and Stories</li>
        <li>Mental Health</li>
        <li>Social Media</li>
        <li>The State of the World</li>
        <li>Money & Financials</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Technology & Homelab</li>
        <li>Security</li>
        <li>Artifical Intelligence</li>
        <li>Video Games</li>
        <li>Health & Diet</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Relationships</li>
        <li>Work</li>
        <li>Networking</li>
        <li>Climbing</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Study & Personal Development</li>
        <li>Books</li>
        <li>Sports</li>
        <li>Travel</li>
    </ul>
</div>

## Current State
Right now this it absolutely barebones, but its using some cool tools, it was created with Jekyll and hosted / stored with github, I don't have a proper name for this blog, so I'll just start with **"Forbesii Blog"**, not that great, but it's better than having nothing.
Although when I actually think about it, this may also have aspects of being kinda like a diary of certain events, and I also plan to retroactively add previous things I've done and my thoughts on it.

There's quite a bit of work to do here with the infrastructure, but for each major version I'll keep it tracked through git, I've always enjoyed the git workflow and this is a good way to have branches for post and to just learn more, sometimes I'll need to add things like tags, but those don't change the actual content so I'll just add like 1.1, but I'll work on that in the future 

## Future State
I'm planning on having pages be either a blog type thing or more of a guide, but that's still all a work in progress.
once I post something I want to make sure it doesn't change unless there's a security / privacy or I just no longer want this even possibly available in a public space.

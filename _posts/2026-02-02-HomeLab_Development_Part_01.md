# Building HomeLab v2
I will now be starting to work on my second proper homelab, the first I made was just working to get everything together and the second is going down the IaC rabbit hole and just trying to make everything in a more standard manner, I think this will be a really good learning experience to me.

## The Hardware
3x Lenovo Mini PC m900
1x UPS
1x tp-link
Lab Rax

## Capabilities
IaC - Ansible / Terraform
Load Balancing
Kubernetes Backplane
SSL Encryption
DNS - WAN & LAN
Network Boot
Passwords for select blogs

## Networking
The initial version will use the default router the IPS provided, however it will be changing to OPFsense
Separate VLANs

# Keeping Track
I want to try to keep track of all the IP addresses and IaC for the config as required to practice document writing

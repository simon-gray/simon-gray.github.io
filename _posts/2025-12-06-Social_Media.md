# Social Media
I'm not a huge fan of social media and my perceived direction of where it's going, I recently deleted Instagram and there's now only a couple of social media apps that I still us, and one of the main ones is YouTube and Reddit, which are both still taking an unacceptably large amount of my time.
I have personally been feeling like I've got [Brain Rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_rot) because I spend so much time not doing anything and just relying so much on the fact that I've already got a job that doesn't require me to do anything to be able to meet the minimum requirements, there's a few certifications I've studied for recently but I didn't actually try to learn the content, but try to pass the exam instead.

## Social Media Perspective
I don't think that social media is a black or white issue, getting it right really depends on the person and how they use it, having something outside of it which you do and then just use the social media to keep up with what others are doing, this can be quite healthy, but if you just stay inside all the time and use social media to see what you want your life to be like without doing the actual work that's required.

# AI
This is something that I've been thinking about quite a bit, it's an amazing thing, that's so very powerful, but at the same time what's going on with the world is so very concerning, recently we've just had Micron announce it's exit from Crucial consumer business [ref](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business), this will impact consumers and there's quite a bit of talk about corruption.

## Smart Usage
AI is a tool, and like any tool it's value depends on how you use it, just blindly using it is an issue, but being able to fundamentally trying to understand the rational for what's going on and then learning the foundation is how to really get value from it

## Time and Place
Sometime you don't need to learn why AI is doing certain things, you just want to get it to work, there are many examples where this is valuable, for example you're using someone else's code and just want to get it working, as you won't be rewriting it and just treating it as a black box

# Learning
This is something which I have been really questioning about myself, I need to learn and keep developing, it's so very important to me, and yet I haven't been actually learning anything, but I feel like I'm just a floating piece of driftwood floating around wherever the water takes me. This isn't something that I'm OK with, but I just haven't been able to find a real direction that I want to go, I've applied for and got accepted in other roles but that's also

## Motivation & Goals
Having motivation is one of the most important things for learning, I find that I'm currently in quite a rut, I'm trying to learn as much as I can about Linux right now, along with infrastructure which I hope to turn into a future job, but at the moment it feels more like I'm just a a piece of driftwood floating around, but doesn't have an actual direction on where I want to go, which is really slowing my development, because I want to have something that I can really be studying for. Social media isn't so much the real issue, it's that being your only thing and not having anything else to get your outside and actually living your life. 

## Symbolic Misery
"Stop creating, and only consume"
"Stop thinking critically, and only react emotionally"

Was watching a video by Internet Education "The Brainwash of Disney Adults" which I felt was quite relevant


# Overall Thoughts
This is something which I'm still working to understand more about, because I do see the benefits that it has, and there is a certain need for it to retain connections.
At the end of the day it really is all the personal preference, and something which I'm trying to learn more about what's right for me.

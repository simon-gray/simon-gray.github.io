# Creating an nvim plugin
Right now it's called scaffold and it's for inputing a template or 'scaffold' into whatever you're working on, this all started because I was using obsidian and needed a quick way to make sure that all of the front matter was added to the required format, and doing that in nvim can take a bit of time and doing it multiple times is quite annoying.

## Creation
This plugin was generated using AI for the initial design, but as I'm using it more that's changing and modifications are getting made which meet my specific use case instead of being quite general in nature. But because it was generated using AI I still don't have a very good idea of how lua works, so this is something that I'll be working on more in the future.
